# Code-push tab completion

Adding tab completion to the CodePush CLI (https://github.com/Microsoft/code-push). Bash only as of now.

### Quick start
 1. Copy complete.sh into a static location
 2. From command prompt, run `source path/to/complete.sh`
 3. You now have tab completion for code-push cli

In order to persist completion across sessions, add the `source path/to/complete.sh` line to your bash profile (usually at ~/.bash_profile. See [the documentation](http://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/sect_03_01.html) for more shell initialization information)
